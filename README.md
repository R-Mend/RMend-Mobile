RMend-Mobile is the react native mobile app for end-users (county citizens and employees) that allows them to create and view reports.

## Usage example

An example of how RMend mobile works is...
1. Signing the user in
2. Showing the user the create report views (location map, type/detail, sender info)
3. Forming the data into a report
4. Sending the newly created report to the backend API to be processed and saved

## Development setup
